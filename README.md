# What Is This?

This is a collection of mods, soundpacks, and tilesets for [Cataclysm: Dark
Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/) (CDDA). These game
extensions are scattered across the internet, often in very inconvenient
places (like MediaFire and Mega), which makes using them harder than it needs
to be.

I've collected a selection of these extensions in this repo to make it easy to
provide them in an automated fashion for use with my [catalauncher command
line launcher for CDDA](https://github.com/houseabsolute/catalauncher) .

If you are the author of one of these extensions and have any issues or
questions about this [please let me know](mailto:autarch@urth.org). If you'd
like me to remove something of yours I'm happy to do that.

Most of these extensions do not have an explicit license so I'm assuming that
they were released under the same license as CDDA itself unless otherwise
specified, the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported
License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

If there's a mod you'd like added please create a PR or [file an
issue](https://github.com/houseabsolute/cataclysm-extras-collection/issues).
